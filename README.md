# dotfiles
These dotfiles are used on my (desktop) debian systems aiming towards consistent environments.

# Prerequisites
* Debian 12 (as of now 12.7)
* Wayland w/ sway

These dotfiles are always in development and do not always represent the current state that they are in, as they are changed throughout time.
In these files I take inspiration from other people too, so all credits to who helped me out too.
