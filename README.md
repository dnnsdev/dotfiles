# dotfiles
These dotfiles are used on my (desktop) debian systems aiming towards consistent environments.

# Prerequisites
* Debian 12 (as of now 12.7)
* Wayland w/ sway

These dotfiles are always in development and do not always represent the current state that they are in, as they are changed throughout time. In these files I took inspiration from other people too, so all credits to whom helped me out too.

No licence, feel free to take what you like. I'm not responsible for broken systems ;-).
