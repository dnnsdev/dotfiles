# dotfiles
These dotfiles are used on my (desktop) debian systems aiming towards consistent environments.

# Prerequisites
* Debian 13 - also works with `trixie/sid`
* [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) with [Sway](https://swaywm.org/)

# Install
* Clone repo in root of user directory (e.g. /home/user)
* `chmod +x scripts/setup_environment.sh`
* `./scripts/setup_environment.sh`

## Alternative install
```bash
cd ~
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/dnnsdev/dotfiles
git pull origin main
```

These dotfiles are always in development and do not always represent the current state that they are in, as they are changed throughout time. In these files I took inspiration from other people too, so all credits to whom helped me out too.

No licence, feel free to take what you like. I'm not responsible for broken systems ðŸ‘Œ.

## Post-install
After rebooting, you may need to:
* Log out and log back in for group changes to take effect
* Configure your shell to use the new dotfiles
* Restart any applications that use the new configurations
